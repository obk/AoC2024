# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions
=====================================

### Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, all implemented in Python within a single Jupyter Notebook for convenience and readability.

### Repository Structure

- **AoC2024.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all solutions for the 2024 challenges. Each day's challenge is solved within a separate cell or section for clarity.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview, usage instructions, and any relevant notes about the solutions.

### Usage

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x (Tested on Python 3.12.3)
   - Jupyter Notebook/Jupyter Lab (For running `AoC2024.ipynb`)

2. **Running the Solutions**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Open `AoC2024.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
   - Ensure you have the necessary Python version and libraries installed. Most solutions rely on the Python Standard Library, but any additional requirements will be noted in the relevant sections of the notebook.
   - Execute each challenge's cells in order to see the solutions in action.
